# Chicago-Speed-Violations
Visualizations based on data created from Chicago's speed violations

### Visualization 1: Violation by Area Type
My visualizations began by playing around with the differences between parks and schools. It quickly led me to my first finding that park violations were declining at a quicker rate than schools. I also wanted to clearly point out the trendline, so I made the data line opaque for emphasis.

### Visualization 2: Camera Forecast by Type
I enjoyed the results I found with how parks make a difference compared to schools so I took it a step further and added a forecast to see if it highlights the effect, and it certainly did. I added a similar format here to emphasize the trendline.

### Visualization 3: Violations in Parks per Weekday
My final visualization is mostly meant to drive home the point of my graphs. I filtered for parks to show there is a clear difference for parks in weekends vs weekdays. Allowing cameras to be off in school zones on weekends is enabling violators on the worst days.

I summed the total violations, the weekday violations, and the weekend violations and used simple math to come up with the fact that weekends have 28% higher average violations.

## Roadmap

I'm very happy with how my findings have turned out so far. I might be able to improve further on what concrete changes might occur with keeping cameras on during weekends in school zones.
It is also possible that I could find other ways to represent exactly what is happening and why there is such a significant difference between parks and schools.
